# SLRKIT command
The `slrkit` command helps to handle a slr-kit project.
This command automates and handles all the phases of the document analysis.
To do so, a set of configuration files are used in order to automate the process.
These files are stored in a slr-kit project and are created and managed by the `slrkit` command itself.

## SLR-KIT projects

An SLR-KIT project is a collection of files generated by the SLR-KIT scripts.
All of these files, are generated from a set of documents that the user wishes to analyze.
A project is also a `git` repository.
The `slrkit` command initializes this repository when the project is first created and helps to track only the meaningful files.

### Anathomy of a project
An SLR-KIT project is a directory that contains all the files related to an analysis.
This directory must contain also a `META.toml` file and a project configuration directory.

#### META.toml
This file contains all the metadata about the project.
It must be a [TOML version 1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0) file.
It must contain two dictionaries: `Project` and `Source`.

##### `Project` dictionary
This contains information about the project such as the name of the project, a description, the location of the configuration directory and some more.
The allowed keys and their meaning are described in the following table:

| Key         | Description                                 | Type            |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|:---------------:|
| Author      | Information about the author of the project |      string     |
| Config      | Name of the configuration directory         |      string     |
| Description | Description of the project                  |      string     |
| Keywords    | List of keywords related to the documents   | list of strings |
| Name        | Name of the project                         |      string     |

##### `Source` dictionary
This contains information about the source of the documents analyzed in the project.
The allowed keys and their meaning are described in the following table:

| Key    | Description                                    | Type   |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|:------:|
| URL    | URL of the site used to retrieve the documents | string |
| Query  | Query string usedto retrieve the documents     | string |
| Date   | Date on which the documents were retrieved     | string |
| Origin | Description of the origin of the documents     | string |

The `Origin` key is meant to be used when the documents are retrieved without the help of a bibligraphical search engine.
In this case the `URL` and `Query` keys shall be left empty.

#### The project configuration directory
This directory is located inside the project directory.
Its name is saved in the `META.toml` file in the `Project.Config` key.
The default name for this directory is `slrkit.conf` but a different name may be used.
This directory contains all the configuration files used by the project.
The configuration files must be TOML v. 1.0.0 files.
Information about each file can be found in the documentation of each `slrkit` subcommand.
Each relative path included in the configuration files are considered to be relative to the project root directory.
The configuration directory contains also a `log` directory that contains all the log files produced during the project.
All the scripts that write a log use the `slr-kit.log` log file saved in the log directory.

## The `slrkit` command
The `slrkit` command is the tool to handle a project.
It uses the `META.toml` and the file in the project configuration directory to automate the operations.
It is composed by some sub-commands to handle and automate all the phases of a project.

Usage:

    python3 slrkit.py [-C /path/to/project] sub-command sub-command-arguments ...

The sub-commands are:

* `init`: initialize a slr-kit project
* `import`: import a bibliographic database converting to the csv format used by slr-kit.
* `journals`: subcommand to extract and filter a list of journals. Requires a subcommand.
* `acronyms`: extract acronyms from texts.
* `preprocess`: run the preprocess stage in a slr-kit project
* `terms`: subcommand to extract and handle lists of terms in a slr-kit project. Requires a sub-command
* `fawoc`: run fawoc in a slr-kit project.
* `lda`: run the lda stage in a slr-kit project
* `report`: run the report creation script in a slr-kit project.
* `optimize_lda`: run an optimization phase for the lda stage in aslr-kit project, using a GA.
* `record`: record a snapshot of the project in the underlying git repository
* `lda_grid_search`: run an optimization phase for the lda stage in a slr-kit project using a grid search method.

Each command operates on the directory from which the `slrkit` command is run.
The `-C` option allows to change the current directory to the one specified.

### init
Initialize the current directory as an SLR-KIT project.
Usage:

    python3 slrkit.py init [--author AUTHOR] [--description DESCRIPTION] [--no-backup] name

Argument `name` is the name of the project.
It will be used as a prefix for all the suggested file names.
The `--author` option allows to specify the project author while the `--description` option allows to specify the project description.
It creates the `META.toml` files with information from the command line.
**The user shall complete the content of this file**.

This command also creates the configuration directory.
This directory is populated with all the configuration files handled by the `slrkit` command.
The file format is [TOML version 1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0).
The name of each file is the name of the `slrkit` sub-command (e.g. `preprocess.toml` is the configuration file for the `slrkit preprocess` command) and it contains a key for each parameter of the corresponding script.
Refer to the documentation of each script for additional information about the configuration parameters.
In each file some comments explain each parameter, and the output file name of each script are suggested with some good default names.

This command can be executed on an already initialized project.
In this case the information in the `META.toml` are updated with the ones given on the command line.
All the other fields are left untouched.
The configuration files are updated.
If one or more option are missing, they are filled with the default value.
The other information are not changed.
The original `toml` files are backuped in the configuration directory before any modification.
The backups have the same name of the original files with the extension `.bak`.
If the user gives the `--no-backup` option, no backup is performed.

The `init` sub-command also initializes the `git` repository of the project.
A `.gitignore` file is provvided with some useful patterns.
A first commit is recorded with:

* the `META.toml` file;
* all the configuration files;
* the provvided `.gitignore`.

### import
This command imports a bibliographical database into the project, converting it to the `Â¢sv` format used by all the scripts.

Usage:

    python3 slrkit.py import [--list_columns]

The `import` sub-command uses the `import.toml` configuration file and runs the `import_biblio.py` script.
It imports the database in a `csv` usable by the other commands.
To each paper is assigned a progressive identification number in the column `id`.
All the selected columns are imported from the input file.
The citation count for each paper is also retrived and imported as the column `citation`.
If the option `--list_columns` is set, the command outputs only the list of available columns of the input file specified in the configuration file and no data is imported.

After a correct execution, the command changes `journals_extract.toml`, `journals_filter.toml` and `report.toml` files updating their `ris_file` field with the name of the input file.

The `import.toml` has the following structure:

* `input_file`: path to the bibliographical database to import. **Important:** this field is not pre-filled by the `init` command, the user **must** fill it before running the `import` command. This file is committed to `git` repository by the `record` command;
* `type`: type of the database to import. Actually the only supported type is `RIS`;
* `output`: name of the output file. It is pre-filled with `<project-name>_abstracts.csv`;
* `columns`: comma separed list of columns to import. It is pre-filled with `title,abstract,year`. Additionally, a `citation` column is also imported by default.

### acronyms
This commands extracts acronyms from the papers.
Its output format is suitable to be used with `FAWOC` to classify which acronym is relevant or not.

Usage:

    python3 slrkit.py acronyms

The `acronyms` sub-command uses the `acronyms.toml` configuration file and runs the `acronyms.py` script.
The output is in `tsv` format and has the following structure (suitable for `FAWOC`):
* `id`: a progressive identification number;
* `term`: the acronym in the form `extended-acronym | (abbreviation)`;
* `label`: the label added by `FAWOC` to the acronym. This field is left blank by the `acronyms` command.

No `fawoc_data` file is produced, so no `count` field is available for `FAWOC`.

After a correct execution, the command changes the `preprocess.toml` file updating its `acronyms` field with the name of the output file.

The `acronyms.toml` has the following structure:

* `datafile`: input file. It is pre-filled with the value `<project-name>_abstracts.csv`;
* `output`: output file. It is pre-filled with the value `<project-name>_acronyms.csv`;
* `columns`: name of the column of `datafile` with the text to elaborate. It is prefilled with the value `abstract`.

### preprocess
The `preprocess` sub-command uses the `preprocess.toml` configuration file and runs the `preprocess.py` script.

### gen_terms
The `gen_terms` sub-command uses the `gen_terms.toml` configuration file and runs the `gen_terms.py` script.

### lda
The `lda` sub-command uses the `lda.toml` configuration file and runs the `lda.py` script.

### lda_grid_search
The `lda_grid_search` sub-command uses the `lda_grid_search.toml` configuration file and runs the `lda_grid_search.py` script.

### fawoc
The `fawoc` sub-command uses the `fawoc.toml` configuration file and runs the `fawoc` tool.
The profiler file is saved in the `log` directory inside the configuration directory.
The profiler is called `fawoc_profiler.log`.
