# SLR-KIT projects

An SLR-KIT project is a collection of files generated by the SLR-KIT scripts.
All of these files, are generated from a set of documents that the user wishes to analyze.
A project is handled by the `slrkit` command.
This command automates and handles all the phases of the documents analysis.
To do so, a set of configuration files are used in order to automate the process.

## Anathomy of a project
An SLR-KIT project is a directory that contains all the files related to an analysis.
This directory must contain also a `META.toml` file and a project configuration directory.

### META.toml
This file contains all the metadata about the project.
It must be a [TOML version 1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0) file.
It must contain two dictionaries: `Project` and `Source`.

#### `Project` dictionary
This contains information about the project such as the name of the project, a description, the location of the configuration directory and some more.
The allowed keys and their meaning are described in the following table:

| Key         | Description                                 | Type            |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|:---------------:|
| Author      | Information about the author of the project |      string     |
| Config      | Name of the configuration directory         |      string     |
| Description | Description of the project                  |      string     |
| Keywords    | List of keywords related to the documents   | list of strings |
| Name        | Name of the project                         |      string     |

#### `Source` dictionary
This contains information about the source of the documents analyzed in the project.
The allowed keys and their meaning are described in the following table:

| Key    | Description                                    | Type   |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|:------:|
| URL    | URL of the site used to retrieve the documents | string |
| Query  | Query string usedto retrieve the documents     | string |
| Date   | Date on which the documents were retrieved     | string |
| Origin | Description of the origin of the documents     | string |

The `Origin` key is meant to be used when the documents are retrieved without the help of a bibligraphical search engine.
In this case the `URL` and `Query` keys shall be left empty.

### The project configuration directory
This directory is located inside the project directory.
Its name is saved in the `META.toml` file in the `Project.Config` key.
The default name for this directory is `slrkit.conf` but a different name may be used.
This directory contains all the configuration files used by the project.
The configuration directory contains also a `log` directory that contains all the log files produced during the project.
All the scripts that write a log use the `slr-kit.log` log file saved in the log directory.

## The slrkit command
The slrkit command is the tool to handle a project.
It uses the `META.toml` and the file in the project configuration directory to automate the operations.
It is composed by some sub-commands to handle and automate all the phases of a project.
These sub-commands are:

* `init`: initialize a slr-kit project;
* `import`: import a bibliographic database converting to the csv format used by slr-kit;
* `acronyms`: extract acronyms from documents;
* `preprocess`: run the preprocess script;
* `gen_terms`: run the gen_terms script;
* `lda`: run the lda script;
* `lda_grid_search`: run the lda_grid_search script;
* `fawoc`: run fawoc.

### init
Initialize the current directory as an SLR-KIT project.
It creates the `META.toml` files with information from the command line.
The user shall complete the content of this file.
This command also creates the configuration directory.
This directory is populated with all the configuration files handled by the `slrkit` command.
The file format is [TOML version 1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0).
The name of each file is the name of the `slrkit` sub-command (e.g. `preprocess.toml` is the configuration file for the `slrkit preprocess` command) and it contains a key for each parameter of the corresponding script.
Refer to the documentation of each script for additional information about the configuration parameters.
In each file some comments explain each parameter, and the output file name of each script are suggested with some good default names.

### import
The `import` sub-command uses the `import_biblio.toml` configuration file and runs the `import_biblio.py` script.

### acronyms
The `acronyms` sub-command uses the `acronyms.toml` configuration file and runs the `acronyms.py` script.

### preprocess
The `preprocess` sub-command uses the `preprocess.toml` configuration file and runs the `preprocess.py` script.

### gen_terms
The `gen_terms` sub-command uses the `gen_terms.toml` configuration file and runs the `gen_terms.py` script.

### lda
The `lda` sub-command uses the `lda.toml` configuration file and runs the `lda.py` script.

### lda_grid_search
The `lda_grid_search` sub-command uses the `lda_grid_search.toml` configuration file and runs the `lda_grid_search.py` script.

### fawoc
The `fawoc` sub-command uses the `fawoc.toml` configuration file and runs the `fawoc` tool.
The profiler file is saved in the `log` directory inside the configuration directory.
The profiler is called `fawoc_profiler.log`.
